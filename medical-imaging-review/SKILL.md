# Theoretical Literature Review Expansion Skill

Expand short theory drafts into publishable academic literature reviews.

---

## Core Functions

This skill helps you:

- Expand theory sections into full literature reviews
- Add authoritative citations and theoretical grounding
- Clarify causal mechanisms
- Formulate testable hypotheses
- Improve academic tone and structure

---

## Writing Principles

### Academic Style
- Use hedging: "may", "suggests", "likely", "can be understood as"
- Avoid absolute claims
- Emphasize causal logic
- Maintain formal academic tone

### Required Elements
Each mechanism must include:
- Concept definition
- Theoretical foundation
- Causal pathway
- Supporting literature
- Testable hypothesis

## Standard Structure for Theory Expansion

```markdown
## 1. Conceptual Background
- Define core concepts
- Clarify institutional context

## 2. Theoretical Foundations
- Transaction cost theory
- Institutional economics
- Law and economics
- Political economy of decentralization

## 3. Mechanisms
### 3.1 Cost Effect
### 3.2 Judicial Protection Effect
### 3.3 Regulatory Risk Effect

## 4. Research Hypotheses

H2:
H3:
H4:

## 5. Implications for Market Integration


### [Mechanism Name]

**Concept:** Define the mechanism.

**Theoretical Logic:**  
Explain causal chain:
Institutional change → Firm behavior → Market outcome

**Literature Support:**  
Summarize key studies and their relevance.

**Implications:**  
Explain expected behavioral changes.

**Hypothesis:**  
H#: [Testable statement]

## Citation Patterns

```markdown
# Data citation
"...achieved Dice of 0.89 [23]"

# Method citation
"Gu et al. [45] proposed..."

# Multi-citation
"Several studies demonstrated... [12, 15, 23]"

# Comparative
"While [12] focused on..., [15] addressed..."
```
