# Theory Mechanism Expansion Skill

Expand short drafts into rigorous, literature-grounded theoretical mechanisms
with testable hypotheses.

This skill is optimized for research on:
- Legislative decentralization
- Institutional heterogeneity
- Judicial local protection
- Regulatory enforcement
- Market integration and segmentation

---

## Core Functions

This skill helps you:

- Expand brief ideas into full theoretical mechanisms
- Clarify causal pathways (institution → firm → market)
- Integrate supporting literature
- Formulate testable hypotheses
- Ensure academic rigor and coherence

---

## Writing Principles

### Academic Style
- Use hedging: "may", "suggests", "likely", "can be understood as"
- Avoid absolute claims
- Emphasize causal logic
- Maintain formal academic tone

### Required Elements per Mechanism

Each mechanism must include:

1. Concept definition  
2. Theoretical logic (causal chain)  
3. Literature support  
4. Behavioral implications  
5. Testable hypothesis

## Standard Output Structure

The skill produces a four-mechanism framework:

```markdown
# Theoretical Mechanisms and Research Hypotheses

## H1 Cost Effect
## H2 Judicial Protection Effect
## H3 Regulatory Risk Effect
## H4 Market Segmentation Effect
```

---

## Mechanism Expansion Template

```markdown
## H#: [Mechanism Name]

### Concept
Define the mechanism and key constructs.

### Theoretical Logic
Institutional change → Firm behavior → Market outcome

### Literature Basis
Summarize relevant theoretical and empirical studies.

### Implications
Explain expected changes in firm behavior.

### Hypothesis
State a clear, testable hypothesis.
```

---

## Citation Guidance

Use citations to support theoretical claims:

```markdown
# Theory citation
"Transaction cost theory suggests that institutional differences increase compliance costs [Author, Year]."

# Empirical citation
"Empirical studies find that local firms often enjoy higher litigation success rates [Author, Year]."

# Comparative citation
"While some studies emphasize regulatory efficiency, others highlight enforcement disparities [Author, Year; Author, Year]."
```

---

## Integration Guidance

When expanding multiple mechanisms:

- Ensure mechanisms are logically consistent
- Explain how mechanisms interact
- Show cumulative effects on market integration
- Avoid redundant explanations across hypotheses

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

- Expand theoretical mechanisms from notes
- Develop literature-based hypotheses
- Clarify causal pathways in institutional research
- Strengthen theory sections for empirical papers

---

## Output Goal

Produce a concise, literature-grounded theoretical framework
with four mechanisms and testable hypotheses suitable for
inclusion in an academic paper.
