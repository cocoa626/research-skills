# Quality Checklist for Theory-Driven Literature Reviews
## (Institutional Economics, Law & Economics, Political Economy)

This checklist ensures academic rigor for theory sections and literature reviews
focused on legislative decentralization, institutional differences,
judicial protection, and market integration.
