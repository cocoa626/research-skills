# Quality Checklist for Theory Mechanism Development
## (Four-Hypothesis Framework)

This checklist ensures rigor and clarity when developing
literature-based theoretical mechanisms and hypotheses.

Applicable to research on legislative decentralization,
institutional differences, judicial protection, and market integration.

# Pre-Submission Checklist

## 1. Conceptual Clarity

- [ ] Core concepts clearly defined:
  - Legislative decentralization
  - Institutional heterogeneity
  - Judicial local protection
  - Regulatory enforcement intensity
  - Market integration vs segmentation
- [ ] Distinctions between related concepts clarified
- [ ] Scope and boundary conditions specified

---

## 2. Theoretical Logic

- [ ] Clear causal chain:
  Institutional change → Firm behavior → Market outcomes
- [ ] Mechanisms explained step-by-step
- [ ] Assumptions stated explicitly
- [ ] Alternative explanations acknowledged

---

## 3. Literature Support

- [ ] Foundational theories cited:
  - Transaction cost economics
  - Institutional economics
  - Law & economics
  - Political economy of decentralization
- [ ] Key empirical studies included
- [ ] Both classic and recent studies referenced
- [ ] Literature synthesized (not listed)
- [ ] Conflicting findings acknowledged

---

## 4. Hypothesis Quality

- [ ] Hypotheses are testable
- [ ] Direction of effect clearly stated
- [ ] Mechanism linking variables explained
- [ ] Hypotheses derived logically from theory
- [ ] No tautological or non-falsifiable claims

---

## 5. Mechanism-Specific Checks

### H1 Cost Effect
- [ ] Compliance and information costs defined
- [ ] Link to transaction cost theory established
- [ ] Impact on cross-regional investment explained

### H2 Judicial Protection Effect
- [ ] Local bias mechanism explained
- [ ] Judicial incentives discussed
- [ ] Enforcement disparities addressed

### H3 Regulatory Risk Effect
- [ ] Enforcement intensity mechanism clarified
- [ ] Litigation risk logic explained
- [ ] Government incentives considered

### H4 Market Segmentation Effect
- [ ] Capital mobility mechanism explained
- [ ] Market integration indicators discussed
- [ ] Combined mechanism logic synthesized

---

## 6. Language & Academic Style

- [ ] Hedging language used appropriately:
  - "may", "suggests", "likely", "can be understood as"
- [ ] Avoid absolute claims:
  - ❌ "proves"
  - ❌ "always"
  - ❌ "definitely"
- [ ] Formal academic tone maintained
- [ ] Terminology consistent throughout
- [ ] Smooth transitions between mechanisms

---

## 7. Logical Integration

- [ ] Mechanisms are internally consistent
- [ ] No contradictions across hypotheses
- [ ] Interactions between mechanisms explained
- [ ] Overall framework forms a coherent narrative

---

## 8. Empirical Readiness (Optional but Recommended)

- [ ] Variables implied or defined
- [ ] Measurement strategies suggested
- [ ] Data sources identifiable
- [ ] Potential endogeneity issues acknowledged

---

# Final Output Check

The theory section should:

- [ ] Present four clearly defined mechanisms
- [ ] Provide literature-grounded causal logic
- [ ] State four testable hypotheses
- [ ] Explain how mechanisms jointly affect market integration
- [ ] Maintain academic rigor and clarity
