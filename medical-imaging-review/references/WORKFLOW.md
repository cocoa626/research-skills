# Theory Mechanism Development Workflow
## (Four-Hypothesis Framework)

This workflow supports building a literature-based theoretical mechanism
with four hypotheses on legislative decentralization and market integration.

It replaces technical review workflows with a streamlined process
for theory-driven research in economics and public policy.

# Phase 1: Topic & Concept Clarification

## Goal
Define core concepts and research scope.

## Actions

1. Define key concepts:
   - Legislative decentralization
   - Institutional heterogeneity
   - Judicial local protection
   - Regulatory enforcement
   - Market integration vs segmentation

2. Clarify research scope:
   - Geographic focus (e.g., China)
   - Level of analysis (firm-level, regional)
   - Institutional context

3. Draft research question:
   - How does legislative decentralization affect market integration?

---

# Phase 2: Literature Collection

## Goal
Build a focused literature base for theoretical mechanisms.

## Data Sources

### 1. Zotero (Primary Source)

Search and organize literature by mechanisms.

**Suggested Queries**
- "legislative decentralization"
- "local protectionism China"
- "judicial independence economic outcomes"
- "regulatory enforcement firm behavior"
- "market integration domestic trade"

**Actions**
- Categorize literature by mechanism (H1–H4)
- Identify seminal works
- Note conflicting findings

---

### 2. ArXiv (Supplementary Working Papers)

Use for recent developments and empirical strategies.

**Suggested Queries**
- "fiscal decentralization governance"
- "institutional distance firm investment"
- "regulatory enforcement economic outcomes"

**Actions**
- Identify emerging debates
- Extract empirical strategies
- Note policy implications

---

# Phase 3: Mechanism Identification

## Goal
Identify causal pathways linking decentralization to market outcomes.

## Actions

1. Extract mechanisms from literature:
   - Cost effect
   - Judicial protection
   - Regulatory risk
   - Market segmentation

2. Map causal chains:
   Institutional change → Firm behavior → Market outcome

3. Compare competing explanations.

---

# Phase 4: Hypothesis Development

## Goal
Translate mechanisms into testable hypotheses.

## Actions

For each mechanism:

1. Define concept
2. Explain causal logic
3. Summarize supporting literature
4. State testable hypothesis

---

# Phase 5: Mechanism Integration

## Goal
Synthesize mechanisms into a coherent theoretical framework.

## Actions

1. Explain how mechanisms interact:
   - Cost ↑
   - Judicial bias ↑
   - Regulatory risk ↑
   → Cross-regional investment ↓

2. Show combined impact on market segmentation.

3. Draft integrated framework narrative.

---

# Phase 6: Empirical Readiness (Optional)

## Goal
Ensure hypotheses are testable.

## Actions

- Identify measurable variables
- Suggest data sources
- Consider identification strategies (e.g., DID)
- Note potential endogeneity issues

---

# Phase 7: Refinement & Quality Check

## Goal
Ensure theoretical rigor and clarity.
