# Theoretical Mechanisms and Research Hypotheses

This section develops four mechanisms through which legislative decentralization
may influence firm behavior and market integration.

## H1 Cost Effect

### Concept
Legislative decentralization increases institutional heterogeneity,
raising compliance and information costs for firms operating across regions.

### Theoretical Logic
Legislative decentralization  
→ regulatory differences expand  
→ firms incur higher compliance and coordination costs  
→ cross-regional investment becomes less attractive  

### Literature Basis
- Transaction cost economics emphasizes the role of institutional differences in raising transaction costs.
- Institutional distance literature shows firms face higher costs when operating under heterogeneous regulatory regimes.
- Studies on interregional trade barriers suggest regulatory variation acts as a non-tariff barrier.

### Hypothesis H1
**After local governments obtain legislative authority, firms experience higher operating costs.**

## H2 Judicial Protection Effect

### Concept
Local legislative authority may increase the influence of local rules
in judicial decisions, potentially creating advantages for local firms.

### Theoretical Logic
Local legislative authority expands  
→ local regulations gain legal weight  
→ courts align with local governance incentives  
→ local firms gain litigation advantages  

### Literature Basis
- Law and economics literature highlights enforcement bias under local government influence.
- Empirical studies document home-court advantage in legal outcomes.
- Research on judicial local protection in China shows higher win rates for local firms.

### Hypothesis H2
**After local governments obtain legislative authority, local firms have higher litigation success rates.**

## H3 Regulatory Risk Effect

### Concept
Stronger legislative authority enhances enforcement tools and legal clarity,
increasing firms’ exposure to litigation and administrative penalties.

### Theoretical Logic
Legislative authority strengthens enforcement capacity  
→ more inspections and clearer penalties  
→ higher probability of lawsuits and sanctions  
→ increased operational risk for firms  

### Literature Basis
- Deterrence theory links enforcement intensity to compliance costs.
- Regulatory economics shows stronger enforcement raises firm risk exposure.
- Studies on administrative penalties demonstrate their impact on firm behavior.

### Hypothesis H3
**After local governments obtain legislative authority, firms face more lawsuits and administrative penalties.**

## H4 Market Segmentation Effect

### Concept
The combined effects of higher costs, judicial local protection,
and regulatory risks reduce cross-regional capital flows,
leading to market segmentation.

### Theoretical Logic
Costs ↑ + Local protection ↑ + Regulatory risk ↑  
→ cross-regional investment declines  
→ capital mobility decreases  
→ market integration weakens  

### Literature Basis
- Market integration theory links institutional barriers to capital immobility.
- Studies on local protectionism show reduced interregional trade and investment.
- Research on judicial bias indicates its role in market fragmentation.

### Hypothesis H4
**Legislative decentralization reduces cross-regional investment and intensifies market segmentation.**
