# Domain Structure: Hypothesis-Driven Framework

This file organizes the literature review around four core hypotheses
on legislative decentralization, institutional differences, and market integration.

## H1. Cost Effect: Legislative Power and Firm Operating Costs

### Concept
Legislative decentralization increases institutional heterogeneity,
raising compliance, information, and coordination costs for firms operating across regions.

### Theoretical Logic
Legislative decentralization  
→ Regulatory differences expand  
→ Firms face higher compliance and information costs  
→ Cross-regional investment becomes less attractive

### Literature Streams
- Transaction cost economics (Coase; Williamson)
- Institutional distance and firm strategy
- Regulatory heterogeneity and entry barriers
- Interregional trade costs within countries

### Common Measures
- Operating cost ratio
- Administrative and compliance expenses
- Time required for approvals
- Multi-region management costs

### Expected Outcome
Firms experience higher operating costs after local legislative power expands.

## H2. Judicial Protection Effect: Local Bias in Legal Enforcement

### Concept
Expanded local legislative authority may increase the influence of local rules
in judicial decisions, potentially leading to local protectionism.

### Theoretical Logic
Local legislative authority expands  
→ Local regulations gain legal weight  
→ Courts align with local governance incentives  
→ Local firms gain litigation advantages

### Literature Streams
- Judicial local protectionism in China
- Home-court advantage in legal decisions
- Law and economics of enforcement
- Political economy of courts

### Common Measures
- Local vs non-local win rates
- Case outcomes by firm origin
- Enforcement disparities across regions

### Expected Outcome
Local firms experience higher win rates in litigation.

## H3. Regulatory Risk Effect: Enforcement Intensity and Legal Exposure

### Concept
Stronger legislative authority may increase enforcement intensity
and legal clarity, raising litigation and administrative penalty risks.

### Theoretical Logic
Legislative authority strengthens regulatory tools  
→ More inspections and clearer penalties  
→ Higher probability of lawsuits and sanctions  
→ Increased operational risk for firms

### Literature Streams
- Regulation and enforcement theory
- Deterrence and compliance economics
- Administrative penalties and firm behavior
- Government incentives and enforcement intensity

### Common Measures
- Number of lawsuits and arbitration cases
- Administrative penalties and fines
- Inspection frequency
- Compliance violations

### Expected Outcome
Firms face increased litigation and administrative penalties.

## H4. Market Segmentation Effect: Reduced Cross-Regional Investment

### Concept
Combined effects of higher costs, judicial local protection,
and regulatory risks reduce cross-regional capital flows,
leading to market segmentation.

### Theoretical Logic
Costs ↑ + Local protection ↑ + Regulatory risk ↑  
→ Cross-regional investment declines  
→ Capital mobility decreases  
→ Market integration weakens

### Literature Streams
- Market integration and segmentation
- Local protectionism and domestic trade barriers
- Capital mobility and regional fragmentation
- Unified market development

### Common Measures
- Cross-regional subsidiary establishment
- Interregional investment flows
- Cross-region M&A activity
- Industrial spatial concentration

### Expected Outcome
Cross-regional investment declines and market segmentation intensifies.

## Optional Section: Moderating Factors

### Regional Heterogeneity
- Marketization level
- Fiscal pressure
- Legal environment quality

### Firm Heterogeneity
- Ownership (SOE vs private)
- Firm size
- Political connections
