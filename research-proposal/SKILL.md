## Phase 3: Outline Generation

### Proposal Structure by Domain

Read the reference file for domain-specific guidance:
- `references/STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md` - Detailed section guidelines
- `references/DOMAIN_TEMPLATES.md` - STEM vs Humanities differences

### Standard Outline Template

```markdown
# [Research Title]

## Abstract (150-300 words, 5-10%)
- Research problem summary
- Research questions/objectives

```

**Note**: Do NOT include Appendix sections. All essential content should be integrated into the main body.

### User Confirmation

**CRITICAL**: Present the outline to the user and wait for confirmation before proceeding to content generation.

```
Present the generated outline and ask:

"Here is the proposed outline for your research proposal:

[Display outline with section titles and estimated word counts]

Please review and let me know:
1. Is the overall structure acceptable?
2. Would you like to add, remove, or modify any sections?
3. Should any section receive more/less emphasis?

I will proceed with content generation once you approve the outline."
```

---

## Phase 4: Content Writing

### Writing Style Guidelines

Read and apply: `references/WRITING_STYLE_GUIDE.md`

#### Key Principles

1. **Academic Register**
   - Formal tone, avoid colloquialisms
   - Third person preferred, limited first person plural ("we")
   - Precise terminology

2. **Prose-Based Writing Style** (CRITICAL)

   **AVOID point-by-point enumeration.** Academic proposals should read as flowing, connected prose rather than bulleted lists or numbered items. Use transitional phrases and coherent paragraphs to present ideas.

   | Avoid | Use Instead |
   |-------|-------------|
   | Bullet points listing objectives | Integrated paragraph describing objectives with transitions |
   | Numbered lists of contributions | Narrative prose explaining contributions in context |
   | Tables for methodology steps | Flowing description of research design |

   **When lists ARE appropriate** (use sparingly):
   - Research questions/objectives (as a focused set of 2-4 items)
   - Timeline milestones (where tabular format aids clarity)
   - Technical specifications that require precise enumeration

   **Example transformation:**

   ❌ Poor (point-by-point):
   ```
   The contributions include:
   - Novel segmentation algorithm
   - Multi-modal fusion framework
   - Clinical validation study
   ```

   ✓ Good (prose-based):
   ```
   This research is expected to advance the field through several interconnected
   contributions. First, the development of a novel segmentation algorithm will
   enable automated plaque detection with accuracy surpassing current methods.
   Building on this foundation, a multi-modal fusion framework will integrate
   complementary imaging data to capture plaque characteristics inaccessible to
   any single modality. Finally, rigorous clinical validation will establish
   the prognostic value of these computational biomarkers for predicting
   cardiovascular events.
   ```

3. **Hedging Language** (Academic Caution)

   | Avoid | Use Instead |
   |-------|-------------|
   | "will prove" | "aims to demonstrate" |
   | "definitely" | "likely", "potentially" |
   | "is obvious" | "evidence suggests" |
   | "proves" | "indicates", "demonstrates" |

3. **Sentence Templates**

   **Introducing Background:**
   - "Over the past decade, [X] has emerged as a critical area of..."
   - "Recent advances in [X] have opened new possibilities for..."

   **Identifying Gaps:**
   - "However, [X] remains poorly understood."
   - "Despite these advances, significant challenges persist in..."
   - "A critical gap exists in our understanding of..."

   **Stating Objectives:**
   - "This research aims to address [X] by..."
   - "The primary objective of this study is to..."
   - "This proposal seeks to investigate..."

   **Methodology Justification:**
   - "Building on previous work, this study proposes to..."
   - "This approach was selected because..."
   - "[Method] offers several advantages for studying [X]..."

   **Expected Contributions:**
   - "This work has the potential to advance..."
   - "The findings may contribute to..."
   - "This research could provide insights into..."

4. **Transitions and Connectors**
   - Addition: Moreover, Furthermore, In addition, Additionally
   - Contrast: However, Nevertheless, Conversely, On the other hand
   - Causation: Therefore, Consequently, As a result, Thus
   - Emphasis: Importantly, Notably, Of particular significance
   - Sequence: First, Subsequently, Finally, Following this

5. **Paragraph Structure**
   ```
   Topic Sentence → Supporting Evidence (with citations) → Synthesis/Implications
   ```
   - 4-8 sentences per paragraph
   - Clear logical progression
   - Explicit transitions between paragraphs

### Citation Formatting

Based on domain:
- **STEM**: APA style (Author, Year)
- **Humanities**: MLA or Chicago style
- **Social Sciences**: APA or Chicago style

First mention of abbreviations: "coronary CT angiography (CCTA)"

Integrate citations into text: "Recent studies (Smith et al., 2023; Jones, 2024) have demonstrated..."

### Figure Suggestions

**IMPORTANT**: Include suggestions for figures at appropriate locations throughout the proposal. Figures significantly enhance readability and demonstrate the applicant's ability to communicate complex ideas visually.

#### Figure Placement Guidelines

Insert figure suggestions using the following format:

```markdown
> **[Figure 1 Suggestion]** *Title: Overview of the proposed research framework*
> Content: A flowchart or schematic diagram illustrating the three-phase research
> design, showing data flow from imaging modalities through AI processing to
> clinical outcomes. Include icons for CCTA/IVUS/OCT inputs, deep learning
> modules, and output predictions.
> Recommended style: Clean vector graphics with consistent color scheme.
```

#### Recommended Figure Types by Section

| Section | Suggested Figure Type |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Introduction** | Conceptual diagram showing research scope and positioning |
| **Literature Review** | Timeline of key developments; Taxonomy/classification of existing methods |
| **Methodology** | Research framework flowchart; Network architecture diagram; Data processing pipeline |
| **Timeline** | Gantt chart showing research phases and milestones |
| **Significance** | Impact diagram showing theoretical and practical contributions |

#### Figure Suggestion Principles

1. **Strategic placement**: Suggest 3-5 figures for a 3,000-word proposal
2. **Self-explanatory**: Each figure should convey key information without requiring extensive caption reading
3. **Consistent style**: Recommend unified visual language (colors, fonts, icons)
4. **Professional quality**: Suggest tools (e.g., Adobe Illustrator, draw.io, BioRender for biomedical)
5. **Accessibility**: Recommend colorblind-friendly palettes and sufficient contrast

### Language-Specific Considerations

#### English Output
- Follow standard academic English conventions
- Use British or American English consistently
- Maintain formal register throughout

#### Chinese Output (中文)
- 使用规范学术中文
- 适当使用 hedging 语言:
  - "本研究旨在探讨..." (not "本研究将证明...")
  - "研究结果可能表明..." (not "研究结果必定显示...")
  - "有望推进..." (not "肯定会推进...")
- 保持正式学术语体
- 参考文献格式遵循 GB/T 7714

## Error Handling

### No Zotero Literature Found
If user's Zotero library has no relevant papers:
1. Inform user of the limitation
2. Rely more heavily on WebSearch for open-access sources
3. Suggest user upload relevant papers and retry

### Insufficient Information
If topic is too vague:
1. Ask clarifying questions about specific aspects
2. Suggest narrowing the research scope
3. Provide examples of well-defined research questions

### Word Count Constraints
If content exceeds target:
1. Prioritize essential sections (Introduction, Methodology)
2. Condense literature review to key points
3. Offer expanded version as separate file
