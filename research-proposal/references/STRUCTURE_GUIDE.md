# Research Proposal Structure Guide

Detailed writing guidance for each section of a PhD research proposal.

---

## Title

### Purpose
Capture the essence of your research in a concise, informative phrase.

### Guidelines
- **Length**: 10-15 words maximum
- **Include**: Key concepts, research object, methodological approach
- **Avoid**: Abbreviations (unless universally known), questions, clever wordplay

### Structure Template
```
[Method/Approach] for [Research Object/Problem] in [Context/Domain]
```

### Examples

**Good Titles:**
- "Deep Learning Approaches for Early Detection of Cardiac Arrhythmias in Wearable ECG Signals"
- "Sustainable Urban Development: A Comparative Analysis of Green Infrastructure Policies in Asian Megacities"
- "Narrative Identity Formation in Digital Spaces: A Longitudinal Study of Young Adult Bloggers"

**Avoid:**
- "A Study of Machine Learning" (too vague)
- "Can AI Save Healthcare?" (question format)
- "The Future of Cities" (too broad)
